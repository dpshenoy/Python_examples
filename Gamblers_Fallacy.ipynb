    "# An Illustration of the Gambler's Fallacy\n",
    "### Flip a fair coin a large number of times.  Early on there may seem to be an excess of Heads or an excess of Tails.  For example, maybe you observe:  \n",
    "$$H, T, T, H, H, H, T, H, H, H, H, H, H, T, H, T, H, T, T, T, H, H, H, H, H, . . .   $$\n",
    "### It looks like an excess of Heads here in the first dozen or two flips.  If the game is to correctly guess H or T, one might be tempted to start betting steadily on T because T \"should\" be more likely to come up next. \n",
    "### That is the gambler's fallacy-- the belief that we should expect a similar excess of Tails to balance out this apparent early excess of Heads.  Clearly H is in the lead right now, so at some point it should flip and T should take the lead, right?  And so for large number of flips, H and T should each be in the lead about 50% of the time, no?  But that is not so   . . . "
